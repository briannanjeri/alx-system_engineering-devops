when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press enter, a complex series of steps occur behind the scenes that allow you to access the google search engine, in this blog post, we will explore the various stages involved in the process. 

  

DNS request 

The first step is your computer sending a Domain Name System (DNS) request to resolve the domain name www.google.com to its IP address. This is done through a DNS server which keeps track of their domain names and their corresponding Ip address. If the DNS server has a record of the IP address, it returns it to your computer. If it does not, it sends a request to another DNS server until the IP address is found. 

  

TCP/IP 

Once your computer has the Ip address it establishes a transmission control protocol/internet protocol with the google web server. Your computer sends a request to the web server and the server acknowledges the request.  

Firewall 

If the web server is behind a firewall, the firewall checks the request to ensure it meets the necessary security protocols. The firewall can block the request if it fails the security checks. 

  

HTTPS/SSL 

If the request is accepted, the server sends a response to your computer. If the website is using Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), an SSL/TLS handshake occurs. During the handshake, your computer and the server exchange cryptographic keys and establish a secure connection. 

  

Load-balancer 

If the website receives a high volume of traffic, it may use a load-balancer to distribute the traffic among multiple web servers. The load-balancer uses a variety of algorithms to ensure that each server receives a fair share of traffic and can handle the load. 

  

Web server 

The web server processes your request and returns the appropriate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to your browser. These files contain the information necessary to render the webpage. 

  

Application server 

If the webpage is dynamic, the web server may send a request to an application server. The application server processes the request and returns the data to the web server, which combines it with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and returns the final result to your browser. 

  

Database 

If the webpage requires data from a database, the application server sends a request to the database. The database processes the request and returns the data to the application server, which uses it to generate the final response to your browser.
